# Tweaks - Extra!

### Why?

I recently moved to Linux as my daily driver, because I was tired of Microsoft invading every part of my computing life. Especially now that Recall is a thing. I also wanted to better support the FOSS community. I really like GNOME, however, there are a few settings that are very hard to
get to, let alone change, without downloading extensions that can break whenever the shell updates.

So, to get around that, I'm building a Python based GUI app that will expose the settings and provide the user with a simple interface for editing. 

### Status

Finished the minimal interface design for the app.
